                    The German Shepherd Dog (GSD) or Deutsche Schäferhund originated from herding breeds in Germany in the late 1800s under the guidance of Captain Max von Stephanitz. It was not long before people realised that this was a dog of extraordinary intelligence suited for working. In 1899, a breed society known as Der Verein für Deutsch Schäferhunde (The Club for German Shepherd Dogs) was formed in Germany. The first registered dog in the studbook was Horand von Grafath.

Early imports of GSDs, known as ‘German sheep dogs’ reached Western Australia around 1904.
Two of these were Freia vom Park and Stephen vom Park. Others were imported to Melbourne around 1925, with other states soon following. In October 1928, the Federal Government banned the importation of GSDs. During the ban, which continued for another 43 years, a number of GSDs were smuggled into the country. The ban was lifted in 1972, with some restrictions remaining until 1976. The breed then enjoyed a surge in popularity, with record numbers of GSDs being shown at national shows during the 1980s. The popularity peaked during the 1990s, when the GSD became the most common breed in Australia in terms of registrations of puppies. Today the breed is still one of the most frequently registered.
